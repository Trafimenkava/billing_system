# Billing system for company 'Velcom'

Billing system is a system that needs to keep track of subscribers and provided services.
The developed system has the next features:
* authorization and authentication;
* creating, editing and deleting tariff plans and groups of tariff plans;
* generation of PDF-document with information about selected tariff plan;
* registration of new user;
* adding and editing information about user;
* adding services and creating of account;
* creating message templates;
* sending notifications.

System was developed in the context of diploma project at BSUIR and it won't be used by 'Velcom'. It's my own made-up customer. Though system was developed for telecommunication company, It can easily reconfigured for providing other services (hosting services, housing and communal services, etc).

The developed system was located on hosting site - [Billing System Velcomve](https://velcom-billing-system.000webhostapp.com/).
